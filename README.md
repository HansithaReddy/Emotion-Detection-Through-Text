# Emotion-Detection-Through-Text
Emotion Detection Through Text is an NLP-based project that classifies emotions from textual input using machine learning. The system leverages a Random Forest Classifier to identify six primary emotions: anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise.

## Key Features

*Text Processing: The input text undergoes tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization for better accuracy.

*Emotion Classification: The trained Random Forest Classifier predicts emotions based on processed text.

*Interactive Interface: A Flask-based web application enables users to input text and receive real-time emotion analysis.

## Technologies Used

*Programming Language: Python

*Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Flask

*Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree

## Project Workflow

*Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing text through tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.

*Feature Extraction: Transforming text into numerical data using TF-IDF vectorization.

*Model Training: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models, with Random Forest as the primary classifier.

*User Interface: Developing a Flask-based GUI for an interactive experience.

## Future Improvements

*Enhanced Accuracy: Fine-tuning the model for better precision and recall.

*Expanded Emotion Categories: Incorporating more nuanced emotions for a broader emotional spectrum.

*Deployment: Hosting the application online for accessibility to a wider audience.
